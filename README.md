# Robot Learning Project

This project explores how a robot can learn to interact with objects using Reinforcement Learning. Specifically, we aim to train the Adeept 5-DOF Robotic Arm to open a box lid and/or grasp an object through trial-and-error learning.

---

## Project Goals

- Build and control a 5-DOF robotic arm
- Use a camera to detect object states (e.g. lid angle, object position)
- Train a reinforcement learning agent to perform simple manipulation tasks

## Getting Started

### 1. Clone the repository

```bash
git clone https://github.com/your-username/robot-learning-project.git
cd robot-learning-project
```

### 2. Set up the environment

We use uv for dependency management.
To install uv got to https://docs.astral.sh/uv/getting-started/installation/

```
uv venv
uv pip install
```
